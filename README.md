# TensorFlow small bites

TensorFlow has a steep learning curve. Most tutorials do a lot of work with very few lines of code. Even after understanding the code and math, I find myself unable to create new code from scratch. "TODO: Write your code bellow" approach in tutorials and online classes doesen't help me much gaining a strong fundation.

I created this tutorial to help myself learn. It is meant to reinforce basic concepts and make sure there are no gaps left unfilled.

If you don't already have a good understanding of Machine Learning, the notebooks will do little to help you.
