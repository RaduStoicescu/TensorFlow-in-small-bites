# TensorFlow small bites

TensorFlow has a steep learning curve. Most tutorials do a lot of work, very fast, with few lines of code. Even after understanding the code and math, I find myself unable to create new code from scratch.

This tutorial is a byproduct of my learning process. 

From notebook to notebook I tried not to add or change more than a couple of lines.

If you don't already have a good understanding of Machine Learning the notebooks are not going to help you much.
