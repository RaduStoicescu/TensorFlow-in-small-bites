# TensorFlow small bites

TensorFlow has a steep learning curve. Most tutorials do a lot of work with very few lines of code. Even after understanding the code and math, I find myself unable to create new code from scratch. "TODO: Write your code bellow" approach in tutorials and Online Classes doesen't help me much.

I created this tutorial to help myself learn. It is meant to reinforce basic concepts and make sure there are no gaps left unfilled.

If you want to follow the tutorial and learn how to use TF you should first take a class in Machine Learning. I foud Andrew Ng's class excelent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeHZOdmJvFU&list=PLZ9qNFMHZ-A4rycgrgOYma6zxF4BZGGPW
